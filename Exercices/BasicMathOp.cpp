/*
ðŸ”¹ Exercise 3: Basic Math Operations

ðŸŽ¯ Objective:

Write a program that:
	1.	Asks the user for two numbers.
	2.	Computes and displays their sum, difference, product, and quotient.


ðŸ“š Key Concepts to Learn:
	1.	User input with std::cin â†’ Reading multiple values.
	2.	Basic arithmetic operators:
	    â€¢	+ for addition
	    â€¢	- for subtraction
	    â€¢	* for multiplication
	    â€¢	/ for division
	3.	Handling division by zero (Hint: check if the second number is 0 before dividing).


ðŸ’¡ Hints to Guide You:
	â€¢	Declare two variables (double is better than int for division).
	â€¢	Use std::cin to get two numbers from the user.
	â€¢	Perform the four basic operations using +, -, *, /.
	â€¢	Be careful with division! What happens if the second number is 0? ðŸ¤”

        std::cout << "Cannot be divid by 0!" << std::endl;

    return 0;
